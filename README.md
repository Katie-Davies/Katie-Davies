Hey there!

I am Katie, a full-stack software developer with a background in Primary teaching. 

I have recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp. An experience that not only taught me how to code but also how to work on a team project with mutiple layers, the importance of Agile roles and effectively communicating a need. I have a passion for making projects that will help others, particularly parents of young children- Checkout MealEasy and Projectbased Learning. My role as a STEAM teacher in Primary was to ignite a passion within our young females to pursue a career in STEAM, I am now praticing what I preach and taking on the challenge of pursuing my own career as a software developer. 

I am excited to begin collaborating with others on exciting projects where I can continue to consolidate and grow my skills as a developer!
