Hey there!

I am Katie, a full-stack software developer with a background in Primary teaching. 

I have recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp. An experience that not only taught me how to code but also how to work on a team project with mutiple layers, the importance of Agile roles and effectively communicating a need. 

I am excited to begin collaborating with others on exciting projects where I can continue to consolidate and grow my skills as a developer!

 üë©üèº‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm currently working on my personal project DirtRider where I am building a platform to allow people to rent out their dirtbikes. I am looking at how to implement Azure AD B2C instead of Auth0.
