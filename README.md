Hey there!

I am Katie, a full-stack software developer with a background in Primary teaching. 

I have recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp. An experience that not only taught me how to code but also how to work on a team project with mutiple layers, the importance of Agile roles and effectively communicating a need. 

✏️ I have recently started blogging about my experiences on this journey- [Medium](https://medium.com/@millerkatie1990)

 👩🏼‍💻 I’m currently working on my personal project DirtRider.
 
 🌱 I’m currently learning PostgreSql, MongoDB and implementing Azure Ad.
